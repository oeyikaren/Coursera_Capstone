    "## Introduction\n",
    "Singapore and Hong Kong are both very diversed and have been the financial hubs in Asia for decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the changes in the economic environments, the number of people who are considering relocating to different countries/cities is on the rise. There are a number of factors when deciding on the city/country to relocate to - e.g. economic environment, political stability, education, cost of living, living environment...\n",
    "\n",
    "While there have been a wide range of comparisons between Singapore and Hong Kong in different aspects, this project wil focus on comparing the neighborhoods of Singapore and Hong Kong to explore the similarity/differences among the neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target audience\n",
    "The target audience for this project is the people who are considering to relocate between Singapore and Hong Kong. Living environment is one of the important factors that they would consider when making the decision if the other city is suitable for relocation. With more similarities between the current and future neighborhoods, it makes it easier for the people to adapt to the new environment. The project will explore the similarity and differences between neighbourhoods in Singapore and Hong Kong, which allows them to evaluate and select the most suitable neighborhood to move to."
